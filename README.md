## Sample Conversation Flows

### Initial Consultation Flow
```
Bot: Hello! I'm FertilityAI, your personal IVF consultation assistant. 
     How can I help you today?

User: I'm interested in learning about IVF options

Bot: I'd be happy to help! To provide you with the most relevant 
     information, may I ask a few questions?
     
     1. What's your age range?
     2. Have you been trying to conceive? If so, for how long?
     3. Have you had any fertility tests done?

User: I'm 32, we've been trying for 18 months, and I had some 
      blood tests done

Bot: Thank you for sharing that information. Based on your age and 
     timeline, IVF could be a great option. Your success rates are 
     quite encouraging - women in your age group have approximately 
     65-70% success rates per cycle at our partner clinics.
     
     Would you like me to:
     🏥 Find nearby fertility clinics
     💰 Provide cost estimates
     📅 Explain the IVF process timeline
     🤔 Answer specific questions about IVF
```

### Cost Estimation Flow
```
Bot: I can help you understand the financial aspects of IVF treatment.
     Let me gather some information:

User: How much does IVF cost?

Bot: IVF costs vary based on several factors. Here's a breakdown:
     
     💉 Basic IVF Cycle: $12,000 - $15,000
     💊 Medications: $3,000 - $5,000
     🧬 Additional procedures (if needed): $2,000 - $8,000
     
     Do you have insurance coverage for fertility treatments?

User: Yes, I have partial coverage

Bot: Great! With partial coverage, your out-of-pocket costs could be 
     significantly reduced. Many insurance plans cover:
     - 50-80% of procedure costs
     - Partial medication coverage
     
     Would you like me to help you:
     📋 Check what your specific plan covers?
     💳 Explore financing options?
     🏦 Find clinics that accept your insurance?
